## :bulb: The idea

Clean-up drives are one of the few major activities that are conducted quite frequently by [Ayudh](https://www.ayudh.in/). The app allows its users to view all clean-up drive events along with all the checkpoints they will be covering. The users can also subscribe to notifications for a particular clean-up drive event.  

## :satellite: Communication and Wiki

The wiki for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/AwesomeFruitSalad/SpicyMarshmallow/wiki).

## :wrench: Tech Stack

The app is built using Java and it follows the MVVM architecture. 

## :dart: Future Scope

The app currently only supports clean-up drive events. The app needs to support all events organised by Ayudh.
